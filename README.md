Full Audit of Greastro Project and Comparison to Industry Standards

Greactstro Project Audit
Project Overview
Greactstro is a content-driven website built with Astro as the static site generator, using React for interactive UI components, MDX/Markdown for content, and TailwindCSS for styling. The project appears to be an Astro Starter Kit extended with custom content collections and dynamic rendering logic. It follows Astro’s Island Architecture: most of the site is pre-rendered to static HTML, while interactive portions are hydrated on the client. The codebase is organized into clear sections for content, components, layouts, and utilities. Overall, Greactstro leverages a modern tech stack, but we will examine its architecture, code quality, and alignment with best practices in detail below.
Structure & Architecture
Project Structure: The repository is structured logically, separating content from presentation:
Content Collections (src/content/) – The site’s core content is managed here using Astro’s Content Collections. There are collections for pages like services, projects, testimonials, FAQ, clients, etc., each with MDX files for individual entries and an _meta.mdx for collection-level metadata
GitHub
GitHub
. For example, src/content/services/ contains several .mdx files (e.g., seo.mdx, web-design.mdx) and an _meta.mdx defining the Services section metadata. These collections are defined in Astro’s configuration with Zod schemas for type safety and consistency
GitHub
GitHub
.
Pages (src/pages/) – Astro page components handle routing. Notably, Greactstro uses dynamic routes for collections: [collection]/index.astro for listing pages and [collection]/[slug].astro for individual item pages. This means any content collection automatically generates a section page and detail pages based on the content. There are also static pages like about-us.astro, contact-us.astro, and policy pages (privacy, cookies) for standalone content.
Layouts (src/layouts/) – Reusable layout components (e.g., BaseLayout.astro, ExtendedLayout.astro) define the overall page structure (including <head> tags, header, footer)
GitHub
GitHub
. ExtendedLayout extends the base layout and provides slots for page-specific content and an extension area (currently a placeholder paragraph)
GitHub
. There are also specialized layout components like SEO.astro for managing meta tags and Theme.astro (likely for theme/style toggling).
Components (src/components/) – UI components are further organized into sub-folders. For example:
components/Section/Section.astro is a critical component that renders a content section on a page. It takes props like collection, query, heading, etc., and orchestrates fetching content and rendering items
GitHub
GitHub
.
components/ItemsTemplates/ contains logic for rendering lists of content items. This includes an Astro component (ItemsTemplate.astro) for server-side rendering and a React component (ClientItemsTemplate.jsx) for client-side interactive rendering
GitHub
GitHub
.
components/LoopComponents/ holds React components used to render individual content items in various ways (e.g., AccordionItem.jsx for FAQ items in an accordion UI
GitHub
, Card.jsx and ListItem.jsx for other display styles, Carousel.jsx for sliding content
GitHub
, etc.). These are effectively “templates” for how to display each content entry.
Other components include the site Header.astro and Footer.astro, menu components (Menu.astro, Submenu.astro, HamburgerMenu.jsx) for navigation, and form input components (e.g., Form/Inputs/TextInput.astro for contact forms
GitHub
).
Utilities (src/utils/) – Contains helper modules that encapsulate complex logic:
SectionUtils and ContentUtils (some written in TypeScript) for tasks like generating IDs, capitalizing strings, and merging section configuration
GitHub
GitHub
.
MenuItemsLoader.js for custom loading of menu items from content (likely aggregating all collection menus into a single structure)
GitHub
.
resolveItemComponent.js which maps a content item’s configured component (string or function) to the actual component module. It uses import.meta.glob to dynamically import the appropriate Astro or React component at runtime
GitHub
GitHub
.
FetchMeta.ts to retrieve collection _meta information, and query utilities for filtering content (like getting related projects for a service, etc.).
This separation of utilities keeps the core components cleaner and improves code readability.
Dynamic Content Architecture: Greactstro’s architecture is highly data-driven. Content collections define not just the data but also how they should appear and relate:
Each collection’s _meta.mdx includes frontmatter for things like heading (section title), description, SEO tags (ogType, keywords), and layout preferences (e.g., whether the collection has its own page, whether individual items have pages)
GitHub
GitHub
. It even can specify sections and itemsSections, which define additional content sections to render on the collection page or on each item’s page
GitHub
GitHub
. For instance, the Services meta defines itemsSections so that on a Service detail page, the site should also show related projects, testimonials, and child/parent services
GitHub
. This indicates a robust system of cross-linking content.
The Section component (Section.astro) is central to how pages are rendered. It takes props that can override or augment the collection’s meta. Internally, it:
Loads Metadata – It calls a utility to get the collection’s meta (from _meta.mdx) given a collection name
GitHub
. This provides defaults for how to display the section.
Merges Props and Defaults – All style and content-related props (classes, heading, description, etc.) are merged with any defaults from the meta and any “variant” presets. The project supports variants: e.g., a "primaryHero" variant might provide default classes for a hero section, defined in a SectionVariants.js map and loaded dynamically
GitHub
GitHub
. Classes from variant, default, and explicit props are combined via a helper mergeClass to form final CSS classes
GitHub
GitHub
.
Determine Content to Render – Section decides if it’s dynamic (has a collection and query prop). If yes, it fetches the relevant content items using getSectionItems (which likely wraps Astro’s getCollection or filter functions)
GitHub
. The query can be things like "getAll" (all items in the collection) or custom ones like "related" or "children" (the utilities use these keywords to filter items based on relationships).
Render Layout – Section then outputs a structured <section> element with optional background media, a heading area, and containers for content. It uses the processed classes and data:
The heading is rendered using a <Heading> component which can handle complex headings with before/after parts (the meta allows e.g., Our Services that we offer, where “Our” and “that we offer” might be in different colors
GitHub
). The Heading.jsx component handles injecting these parts into appropriate <span>s
GitHub
GitHub
.
The section can include a description paragraph below the heading
GitHub
GitHub
.
Content Items: The actual content items (like service cards, FAQ accordion entries, etc.) are rendered via the ItemsTemplate component. Depending on configuration, items can be placed in different parts of the layout (e.g., within the heading area, in the main content area, etc., controlled by itemPlacement props)
GitHub
GitHub
. By default, items render in the main content section if no special placement is set
GitHub
.
Buttons: If the section or meta defines any call-to-action buttons (for example, a “View All” link), those are rendered typically below or above items depending on buttonsPlacement. The code maps an array of button definitions to <Button> components
GitHub
GitHub
.
The Section component is quite extensive (~400+ lines)
GitHub
GitHub
, but it is well-documented with comments for each step. It essentially allows each content section to declare what it wants to show and how, with reasonable defaults and overrides.
Dynamic Pages: The [collection]/index.astro page uses the Section component (or the content’s own MDX) to build the collection page. It determines if a collection has its own page by checking meta.hasPage
GitHub
. If yes, it will include that route. On rendering, it tries to import the collection’s _meta.mdx content as a component (Body)
GitHub
. If the _meta.mdx file has an MDX body (not just frontmatter), it will render that as the page content
GitHub
. This allows for custom layouts per collection. For example, the Services _meta.mdx actually imports and uses multiple <Section> components in its body to lay out the Services page with multiple subsections
GitHub
. If no custom body is provided, the page will fall back to rendering a default section listing all items in that collection
GitHub
GitHub
. This approach is powerful: non-developers could reorder sections or add text by editing the MDX, without touching the page component code.
The [collection]/[slug].astro page generates each item’s detail page. Its getStaticPaths gathers all entries from all collections (except those like menus that are not meant to be pages)
GitHub
GitHub
. It respects an item’s hasPage field (an item can individually opt out of getting a page)
GitHub
. The page then receives the entry (content data) as a prop at build time. It loads the appropriate layout (each collection could specify a different itemsLayout, falling back to a default ExtendedLayout)
GitHub
GitHub
. The content of the MDX entry is rendered via entry.render() to get a Content component
GitHub
, which is then inserted into the layout
GitHub
. After the main content, it renders any sections defined – this could be item-specific sections from the MDX frontmatter or, if none, the default meta.itemsSections from the collection
GitHub
GitHub
. For example, on a Service detail page, after the service’s own description, it might automatically include a list of related Projects or Testimonials as defined in the Services collection meta
GitHub
. This dynamic inclusion is handled by mapping each section definition to the <Section> component, much like in the index page
GitHub
.
Code Quality & Maintainability: The architecture is advanced and well thought-out. Some observations:
The code is heavily commented and documented. For example, Section.astro begins with a clear explanation of how it prioritizes heading/description sources
GitHub
, and the steps in the logic are separated and labeled (1️⃣, 2️⃣, 3️⃣, etc.) in comments. This greatly aids understanding and onboarding new contributors.
Naming conventions are consistent and descriptive. Files and components are named by their function (e.g., ItemsTemplate, resolveItemComponent). Variables in the code (like rawVariant for the prop vs variantDefaults for defaults from theme) are clear.
The project uses Zod schemas (astro:content Zod) to enforce content structure
GitHub
GitHub
. This is a best practice in Astro projects, catching invalid content at build time. The schemas also define relationships, which reduces runtime errors (e.g., referencing a non-existent service in a project’s frontmatter will throw an error).
There is a mix of TypeScript and JavaScript in utilities: some files have .ts (TypeScript) and some .js. The content collections config is in TypeScript (which is great for catching errors)
GitHub
, but certain utils like resolveItemComponent.js are plain JS
GitHub
. Consistently using TS for all logic could further improve reliability, but given Astro supports both, this is more of a stylistic choice.
Complexity vs. Simplicity: The system is quite complex in how it dynamically handles content. This is a double-edged sword:
Pros: Content structure (menus, sections, relationships) is all driven by data, making the site very flexible. It’s easier to add a new collection or change navigation by editing a JSON/MDX file than to hardcode new pages. The approach is scalable and avoids duplication (one generic page handles all collections).
Cons: The abstraction level is high – to understand what happens on a page, one must mentally combine data from content files, the logic in Section, and various utility functions. New developers or editors would require some time to learn this system. However, the thorough commenting and naming mitigate this.
The presence of example or placeholder content (like the mismatched keywords in the Services meta
GitHub
 or the placeholder text in ExtendedLayout footer
GitHub
) suggests the project may be in a development or learning stage. For a production site, those would be cleaned up. This is a content consistency issue more than code quality.
Comparison to Industry Standards: Many modern Astro projects keep things simpler (e.g., writing individual page Astro files for each section). Greactstro’s approach is more akin to a small content management system built on Astro. This is not typical for a simple site, but it is not wrong – it’s actually leveraging Astro’s capabilities to the fullest. In fact, the pattern of content collections + dynamic [collection] pages is encouraged in Astro for blogs and such, although this project extends it further with multi-section pages and menu generation. The design is cutting-edge enough that few Astro projects (as of 2025) might be this dynamic, but it aligns with a component-based, data-driven architecture that modern frameworks promote. If comparing to “industry-standard” Astro projects:
Many would use Astro content collections for blogs or docs, but Greactstro uses them for general site content (services, testimonials) – this is an emerging best practice for content-driven sites.
The use of React for interactivity is common (Astro encourages using framework components for islands). Greactstro goes a step further by lazy-loading and chunk-splitting those components, which is very much in line with performance best practices.
One area where Greactstro diverges from some simpler projects is the manual integration of Tailwind (which we’ll discuss next) and the custom partial hydration handling. Both are responses to new technology (Tailwind 4’s changes and a need for fine-grained control over hydration). These are reasonable choices that advanced Astro users make.
In summary, the project structure and architecture are robust and well-implemented. It shows good code quality with clear organization and documentation. Next, we’ll delve into how each technology (Astro, React, Tailwind, MDX) is utilized within this architecture.
Astro Usage and Versioning
Astro Version: The project’s package.json indicates Astro version 5.x (dependency astro: "^5.9.1"
GitHub
). Astro’s versioning can be confusing (the astro package jumped to 2.0 in early 2023, but the NPM version number is 2.x or beyond). Here, 5.9.1 likely corresponds to Astro 2.9.1 under the hood (Astro’s npm versions have sometimes been ahead; by 2025 Astro might label itself 3.x or 4.x in docs). Regardless, 5.5.6 (as mentioned in the prompt) and 5.9.1 are minor revisions apart, so the project is using a current stable release of Astro. There’s no major mismatch; this is up-to-date and benefits from the latest features and fixes. Astro Integration in the Project:
Content Collections: Astro’s content collection API is used extensively, which is introduced in Astro v2 and improved in later versions. In src/content/config.ts, each collection is defined with defineCollection() specifying how to get its data and its schema
GitHub
GitHub
. Some collections load from MDX files by default, while a couple use JSON or custom loaders (e.g., menus: file(".../menus.json") and menuItems: MenuItemsLoader() for site navigation content
GitHub
). Using reference() in Zod schemas links collections (e.g., a project’s frontmatter can reference services by ID, creating implicit relations)
GitHub
. This is a best practice pattern for Astro to maintain relational content. By enforcing these at build time, the project avoids broken links or missing references in the content.
Routing and Pages: Astro’s file-based routing is complemented by getStaticPaths in dynamic pages. The implementation in [collection]/index.astro collects all collection names and filters out those with hasPage: false
GitHub
GitHub
, ensuring only intended sections have listing pages. Similarly, [collection]/[slug].astro iterates through all collections and all entries to generate individual pages for each, respecting per-entry hasPage flags
GitHub
. This approach uses Astro’s flexibility to generate pages from data. It’s comparable to how one might generate blog posts or docs in Astro, just applied broadly. The code also passes along data (entry and collection via props) to the page component
GitHub
, which is slightly unusual (many Astro examples re-fetch inside the page, but passing via getStaticPaths is more efficient since the data is already loaded).
Astro Components & Islands: Greactstro keeps a lot of rendering logic in .astro files (Section, ItemTemplate for SSR list, layouts, etc.), which means a significant portion of the site is rendered server-side. The Astro/React integration is configured in astro.config.mjs with integrations: [mdx(), react()]
GitHub
. This allows using React components in .astro files with hydration directives. The project uses this in templates: for instance, ItemsTemplate.astro conditionally renders a <ClientItemsTemplate client:...> (which is a React component) when hydration is needed
GitHub
GitHub
. The Astro compiler and runtime handle this seamlessly, server-rendering a placeholder and loading the React code on the client.
Environment and Config: The astro.config.mjs shows usage of environment variables (process.env.PUBLIC_SITE_DOMAIN) to configure the site’s base URL
GitHub
. It also sets a custom dev server port from PUBLIC_DEV_PORT env var
GitHub
. This is a good practice for flexibility across environments. The config uses dotenv in development to load these, which is a standard approach
GitHub
. The site’s domain is thereby injected into any absolute URLs (like for the sitemap or canonical links), ensuring correctness in SEO.
Astro Build Optimizations: The config also customizes the Vite build to separate React into its own chunk named "react-vendor"
GitHub
. This is a performance optimization (so that React doesn’t get re-downloaded if multiple pages use different chunks; it’s cached separately). Many Astro projects do not go this far manually, but this project’s authors have taken care to optimize, indicating awareness of production performance best practices.
Astro vs. Latest Best Practices: Greactstro’s use of Astro is quite aligned with how Astro is intended to be used. A few points to compare with community best practices:
Many Astro projects rely on simpler routing (one .astro file per page). This project’s dynamic routing approach is correct and often seen in larger sites or those generating many pages from content.
The use of Astro.content APIs (like getCollection() inside getStaticPaths)
GitHub
 and entry.render()
GitHub
 is exactly how Astro documentation suggests to use content collections for page generation. It ensures content is only parsed once and reused.
The integration of MDX and React is via official packages, which is standard. No hacky workarounds were used for these, which is good. For instance, older Astro versions required a special .mdx extension handling – here it’s seamless with @astrojs/mdx.
If anything, one area to watch is future Astro updates: Astro might introduce new features (for example, an official way to generate collection index pages without writing getStaticPaths). As of this audit, the custom approach is fine. The project should just be maintained with Astro updates in mind (which they seem to be doing, given minor version bumps from 5.5.6 to 5.9.1).
Astro Version Stability: Since Astro 5.x (2.x in framework terms) is used, the project benefits from stable content collections, hybrid rendering, etc. If Astro releases a major version (say Astro 3.x or 6.x in NPM) with breaking changes, the project might need adjustments (e.g., changes in how integrations or content schemas work). Currently, nothing stands out as a misuse of deprecated features. All Astro usage is modern (the project is clearly built recently, with Astro 2+ features). They even use experimental features like Image component from astro:assets (imported in slug page) for optimized images
GitHub
, indicating an eye on best practices (we will discuss if they fully utilize it later). Summary: Astro is used as the solid foundation of the site. The project structure and dynamic page generation align with Astro’s capabilities and best practices, with thoughtful enhancements for performance. The Astro version in use is current, and no obvious “anti-patterns” in Astro usage are present. The complexity is higher than average, but it’s managed through clear code structure.
React Usage and Frontend Behavior
Greactstro incorporates React primarily to handle interactive components on the frontend. This is a common use-case in Astro – using a framework like React for specific UI pieces that need client-side state, while Astro handles the static rendering of the rest. React Version: The project lists React 19.0.0 and ReactDOM 19.0.0 in its dependencies
GitHub
. This suggests that at the time of setup, react@latest fetched a 19.0.0 version (which, as of mid-2025, is likely a release candidate or experimental version). The stable major version is React 18 (18.2.0 is the latest stable). React 19 introduces some new features (perhaps offscreen rendering API, etc.), but it’s not broadly adopted yet. This is a slight red flag for stability: many libraries (like testing tools or older integrations) expect React 18. Indeed, there have been reports of create-react-app and others accidentally pulling in React 19 and causing peer dependency warnings. Recommendation on React version: If the project isn’t specifically using React 19 features, it would be safer to stick to React 18.x until 19 is officially finalized and supported by Astro’s ecosystem. The Astro React integration (@astrojs/react 4.3.0) likely was built with React 18 in mind. It may still work with 19, but careful testing is needed. For now, we’ll assume the React usage in code doesn’t rely on anything 19-specific, so our analysis will treat it as a typical React 18 scenario. How React is used:
Interactive Components as Islands: In this project, React components are used for specific interactive elements – typically those that involve user interaction (click, toggle, carousel navigation) or complex state logic. Key React components include:
AccordionItem.jsx – Renders a collapsible FAQ item. It uses useState to track open/closed state
GitHub
. On click, it toggles the state, and the JSX uses that state to conditionally apply classes (rotating the arrow icon and expanding the content panel)
GitHub
GitHub
. The content of the accordion (item.data.description ?? item.body) is directly inserted in the JSX
GitHub
. This component is meant to be hydrated on the client because it has interactive behavior. In the content meta, the FAQ section is configured with client: "visible"
GitHub
, meaning Astro will only hydrate it when it scrolls into view, which is efficient. Until then, the content may appear static (if SSR provided it).
Carousel.jsx – Implements a simple horizontal slider for content items
GitHub
. It uses useState for the current index and useEffect for an autoplay interval if enabled
GitHub
. It also handles navigation arrow clicks to change the index
GitHub
GitHub
 and uses a ref to scroll the container smoothly to the active slide
GitHub
. This is a lightweight alternative to using an external carousel library, which keeps bundle size low. The component is rendered within a React <Suspense> with fallback “Loading…” in the client template
GitHub
. That means on initial SSR, the <Carousel> content might not be fully expanded until the client JS loads (but at least a loading indicator is shown).
BeforeAfterSlider.jsx – (If present in the code) would handle an image comparison slider. We saw a reference in search results; this suggests the site might have a feature for comparing two images (common for project before/after showcases). That would be another React component with state for a slider position, etc.
Menu components:
HamburgerMenu.jsx and MenuItem.jsx likely control the mobile menu toggle. For example, HamburgerMenu might use React state to track open/close of the off-canvas menu, and MenuItem.jsx might handle sub-menu expansion. The presence of classes like .menu-item:hover > .submenu in CSS
GitHub
 and the use of focus-within suggest that some menu functionality might be pure CSS on desktop (hover to open dropdowns), but on mobile, a React component could manage state for expanding sections.
This combination of CSS for simple interactions and React for more complex ones is smart: it avoids overusing JavaScript where CSS can do the job (e.g., simple hover menus).
Form components: The form inputs shown (TextInput.astro, Textarea.astro) are Astro components for static form fields
GitHub
. They are not interactive beyond native HTML behavior, so they don’t need React. This means the contact form (if any) might not have custom client logic (no React needed unless form validation was added, which isn’t evident here).
React Integration Mechanism: The Astro React integration (@astrojs/react) allows using React components in .astro files. In Greactstro:
The Section.astro doesn’t directly import React components (except the simple Heading.jsx which is actually used as a server-rendered component for convenience)
GitHub
GitHub
. Instead, Section passes down the component name or reference.
The heavy lifting is done in ItemsTemplate.astro
GitHub
. This component:
Fetches or receives the list of content items.
Sorts them (with a utility)
GitHub
.
Resolve the item component – It calls resolveSSRComponent(ItemComponent)
GitHub
 which returns { RenderComponent, componentKey, componentProps }. ItemComponent could be a string (like "AccordionItem") or an object with {component: ..., props: ...} or a direct function. The resolver utility handles all cases, but essentially it dynamic-imports the desired component module using import.meta.glob and returns the module’s default as RenderComponent
GitHub
GitHub
. For SSR, it will prefer .astro or .jsx files that match the name.
Then, in the Astro JSX markup, ItemsTemplate either renders a React <ClientItemsTemplate> (if hydration is needed) or directly renders an <ul> of <RenderComponent> for each item (if no client interaction)
GitHub
GitHub
.
It explicitly checks client prop for "load", "visible", "idle" and uses the corresponding client:* directive on ClientItemsTemplate
GitHub
GitHub
. If client is falsy, it assumes fully static and outputs the list in pure HTML
GitHub
.
Each item when rendered statically is wrapped in a <li class="contents"> and then <RenderComponent item={item} ... /> outputs the content
GitHub
. RenderComponent might be a React component (Astro can SSR it to HTML since the integration is installed) or an Astro component (which Astro will also SSR normally). Astro’s renderer ensures that even React components produce static HTML on the server.
The ClientItemsTemplate.jsx is the counterpart used when hydrating. It uses React.lazy via resolveCSRComponent(ItemComponent) to get a lazily-loaded React component for each item
GitHub
. It then renders either a <Carousel> (if slider enabled) wrapping those items, or a <ul> with each item rendered via <Comp> (the lazy component) inside a <Suspense> boundary
GitHub
GitHub
. Because it’s all inside <Suspense>, on initial mount the “Loading…” fallback will show until each lazy component has loaded. After that, each item is a live React component (e.g., the Accordion’s toggle state can be used).
This pattern effectively splits the rendering logic: Astro handles initial static HTML (with or without content depending on hydration mode), and React handles client interactions. It’s a clever pattern, albeit complex:
If client is unspecified, the content is fully rendered in HTML (for SEO and immediate viewing) and there is no React overhead.
If client is specified, the content items are not individually rendered to static HTML by Astro (because they go into the lazy-loaded <ClientItemsTemplate>). Instead, Astro’s output will include the <ClientItemsTemplate> placeholder (which in SSR might include the <ul> with Loading… if the Suspense fallback is rendered on server; however, React 18+ SSR would not render the fallback by default – it would attempt to SSR the content. But since resolveCSRComponent uses lazy(import), SSR might not resolve that import in time and thus might actually render fallback. This detail is nuanced). The net result is: those sections might show a loading indicator and then populate on the client. This ensures that complex interactive sections don’t block the main thread during SSR or inflate the HTML size too much, but the trade-off is delayed content visibility.
Design Consistency in React Components: The React components use Tailwind CSS classes heavily for styling, just like Astro components:
E.g., in AccordionItem.jsx, classes like w-full flex justify-between... and conditional rotate-180 are used
GitHub
. This keeps styling consistent with the rest of the site (which also uses Tailwind).
They also receive class names via props (e.g., itemClass) from the Section configuration, so layout classes can be passed in from the meta or variant (like setting a uniform width or margin for all cards)
GitHub
. This is seen where <AccordionItem> is rendered with itemClass={itemClass} in the template, tying the styling to outer config
GitHub
.
Frontend Behavior & Performance: React is only loaded on pages where needed. The Astro integration will ensure that the React runtime (React + ReactDOM) is included once if any client:* component is present. The project’s manual code-splitting also ensures:
React + ReactDOM are bundled separately as react-vendor (likely ~40KB gzip).
Each interactive component (AccordionItem, Carousel, etc.) is in its own chunk, only loaded when needed.
The ClientItemsTemplate.jsx and Carousel.jsx might be combined or separate depending on build optimization. Using <Suspense> and lazy means that even within one section, the code for each item’s component is loaded asynchronously.
This is quite optimal. For example, if the homepage has sections for Services, Clients, Projects, Testimonials, and FAQ
GitHub
GitHub
:
Services, Clients, Projects, Testimonials sections have query="getAll" but likely no client (so they render statically as a list of cards, presumably using a default Card component with no hydration).
FAQ section likely has client: "visible" and uses AccordionItem
GitHub
. So until the FAQ section scrolls into view, none of the React code for AccordionItem or its state is loaded. When it does, a small JS file for AccordionItem and the React state runtime will load, enabling toggling.
If the site has a Carousel (maybe on the homepage hero or elsewhere), that chunk loads only if that section is present and presumably slider.enabled.
The net effect is that initial page load for a visitor might only include the React needed for above-the-fold interactions. Everything else can wait or not load at all if not needed.
React vs. Alternatives: The project chose React for interactivity, which is a fine choice given familiarity and the ecosystem. Astro would also allow using smaller frameworks (like Preact, Svelte, or even Astro’s built-in <script> for minor interactions). Using React is beneficial here because:
The developers can reuse React knowledge to build more complex components (like Carousel or any potential future component).
There are official integrations and type definitions, making it straightforward to work with.
However, React is relatively heavy. An alternative could be using Astro’s own components with some lightweight client script for simple cases like the accordion. Astro 2.x introduced the ability to attach listeners via directives (client:click) on elements or to run small scripts. But those approaches are less structured compared to building a React component. Given the scale (only a handful of interactive components), using React is perfectly valid and the performance overhead is mitigated by code-splitting.
Code Quality of React Components: The React code in Greactstro is concise and focused:
No excessive use of context or heavy libraries; state management is local (e.g., useState, simple useEffect).
The components are function components with hooks, which is the modern recommended style (React 18/19 supports only function components for new features, so that’s good).
Some components (like Heading.jsx) are purely presentational (just returning JSX based on props)
GitHub
, which could have been Astro components, but using React doesn’t harm and may simplify usage in JSX context.
The code is easy to follow. For example, Carousel.jsx clearly separates the concerns: effect for autoplay, effect for snapping to slide, rendering the list. It doesn’t overly optimize or micro-manage (no unnecessary refs or complex math – it relies on CSS scroll snapping which is a modern approach).
Potential improvement: If React 19 is used, one might consider using new React features like the use hook for data fetching or Transition APIs if needed. But those are not relevant to the current use-cases. The current code doesn’t need those, and adding complexity without need would be detrimental.
Summary of React usage: The project makes judicious use of React – only for parts that need it, and even then, deferring loading until necessary. This aligns with Astro’s vision of minimizing JavaScript sent to the browser. By comparing to industry trends:
Using React (or similar frameworks) in Astro islands is common. The approach of lazy-loading each component on demand is a bit more advanced than typical; many might just do <AccordionItem client:visible> directly. Greactstro’s pattern of wrapping items in a ClientItemsTemplate to manage the list is more complex but offers a structured way to handle lists of interactive components.
The performance-first mindset (chunk splitting, suspense) is very much in line with modern best practices (code-splitting, not hydrating until needed, etc.). It’s something larger projects do, but smaller Astro sites might not bother. So Greactstro is ahead of the curve in that sense.
The main caution is the React 19 version: industry standard at this time is still React 18. Unless React 19 has become stable by the time of reading (which it might be close to, given evidence of release candidates), one should treat React 19 as experimental. The recommendation is to downgrade to React 18 for guaranteed stability, or ensure thorough testing and monitoring if sticking with 19 (especially check for warnings in Astro build or runtime about peer compatibility).
With React covered, let’s examine TailwindCSS usage, which concerns design consistency and styling methodology.
TailwindCSS Styling and Design Consistency
TailwindCSS Version: The project uses Tailwind CSS v4 (specifically, Tailwind dependency ^4.0.9)
GitHub
, which is a very recent version (Tailwind 4.0 was released around late 2024). Tailwind 4.x switched to a Lightning CSS-based engine, making it faster and slightly altering configuration (for instance, the older @astrojs/tailwind integration was deprecated in favor of using the Vite plugin for Tailwind 4). Greactstro indeed follows the new integration method:
It installed @tailwindcss/vite (version ^4.0.9, matching Tailwind 4)
GitHub
.
In astro.config.mjs, instead of using integrations: [tailwind()] as one would in Tailwind 3, it manually adds the plugin: vite: { plugins: [tailwindcss()] }
GitHub
. This is exactly what Tailwind’s official Astro guide for Tailwind 4+ suggests. So the integration is correct and modern.
Tailwind Configuration: One thing that stands out is no Tailwind config file (tailwind.config.js) is present in the repository (as far as our search could find). Typically, after installing Tailwind, one would create a config to define the content paths and any theme customizations. The Tailwind official guide for Astro shows setting up a config with the content option (pointing to ./src/**/*.{astro,html,js,jsx,tsx,mdx}) and possibly enabling future flags or theme extensions. The absence of this file means:
The site might be using Tailwind’s default configuration out-of-the-box. Default theme colors, spacing, etc., are available. The project, however, defines its own design tokens via CSS variables (more on that soon), so not customizing Tailwind theme is fine – they use arbitrary values to plug in their design tokens.
More critically, the content purge paths might not be set. In Tailwind 3+, if no content is specified, Tailwind might purge everything (resulting in no styles) or, depending on version, require an explicit config. The Reddit discussion and others have noted that missing content in Tailwind 4 can lead to styles not appearing because the JIT engine thinks no files are specified to scan. Possibly, during development, Tailwind’s JIT (when no content is configured) might watch all files by default, but for production build it could purge all classes (or conversely include none). This could be a bug or oversight that needs fixing. If the site was run and styles were missing, the developer might have noticed and added a quick fix. It’s possible that the code we see was committed before adding the config, or they might be relying on an implicit default. However, best practice is to explicitly specify content.
Design Tokens and Customization: Instead of relying on Tailwind’s theme customization, the project uses CSS custom properties to define design tokens:
In global.css, inside an @theme (likely a custom layer or just global scope), they define variables like --color-bg, --color-primary, --spacing-md, --radius-sm, --shadow-lg, etc.
GitHub
GitHub
. These cover colors, typography (font families), spacing scale, border radius, and shadow presets. This is essentially their design system definitions.
Then, they use these variables in Tailwind classes via the arbitrary value syntax. For example:
A margin-bottom is given as mb-[var(--spacing-sm)] in the FAQ meta frontmatter
GitHub
, which Tailwind will interpret as a custom value for margin-bottom.
Text color classes like text-[var(--color-text)] are used in the heading classes
GitHub
 so that text uses the theme text color variable.
Backgrounds can be similarly set (e.g., bg-[var(--color-bg)] on the main content area in BaseLayout
GitHub
).
This approach means the design tokens can be tweaked in one place (the CSS variables) and the utility classes automatically use the new values. It’s a clever way to combine Tailwind’s utility classes with a centralized theme without writing a custom Tailwind plugin or config. It also means that the site could potentially support dark mode or themes by swapping these CSS variables (since they’re standard CSS variables, one could override them in a .dark theme or via a <Theme.astro> component which might inject a <style> to adjust them).
The project does have a Theme.astro component imported in BaseLayout
GitHub
. It likely handles adding a dark mode class or user theme selection. If implementing dark mode, a common practice is to define alternate values for --color-bg etc. in a :root.dark or [data-theme=dark] context. We didn’t open Theme.astro, but it’s reasonable to assume it might read a cookie or local storage and set class="dark" on html or something. In any case, using CSS variables for colors makes theme switching much easier (Tailwind classes themselves would be static, but variables can change).
Tailwind Utility Extensions: The project adds some custom CSS under @layer base and @layer utilities:
In global.css @layer base, they define base styles for elements (body, and utility classes like .container for centering content)
GitHub
GitHub
. They also define classes .h1 ... .h6 to standardize heading styles (using @apply with Tailwind font-size and font-weight utilities)
GitHub
. This gives them semantic markup (they can use <h2> but also apply class "h2" to get the standardized styling, or use a <Heading> component that outputs a <Tag> with className accordingly).
In global.css @layer utilities, they add custom utilities like .hide-scrollbar (to hide scrollbars, used in Carousel)
GitHub
GitHub
, and a series of menu-related utilities for showing/hiding submenus on hover using Tailwind’s @apply to combine multiple utilities under one class (for example, .submenu is defined to apply opacity-0 pointer-events-none ... by default, and then a group of selectors on hover remove those classes by applying opposites)
GitHub
GitHub
. These are custom but follow Tailwind’s patterns, and by defining them in CSS, they become available project-wide as if they were built-in utility classes.
The animations.css file extends utilities with classes for animations triggered on scroll or load, as we saw
GitHub
GitHub
. This file uses modern CSS features like @supports (animation-timeline: ...) to only enable certain animations in browsers that support the new Scroll-Linked Animations API, and provides an IntersectionObserver-based fallback using a .visible class toggle
GitHub
GitHub
. They define keyframes like fade-in, slide-up etc., and then utility classes .fade-in, .slide-up, etc., to use those animations
GitHub
GitHub
. Tailwind does not (yet) provide scroll-linked animations out of the box, so this custom approach is very forward-looking. They even prefix classes with .load. or rely on adding a .visible class via JS for the fallback, which suggests they might have a small script to add .visible to elements when they enter the viewport (possibly the AnimationLayout.astro or some global script).
All these show a sophisticated use of Tailwind: using it where convenient, but not hesitating to drop into CSS for fine-grained control or new capabilities. This is consistent with best practices – Tailwind encourages customizing via config or CSS layers for things that aren’t covered by core utilities.
Styling Methodology and Consistency:
The site largely adheres to a utility-first CSS approach, meaning most style decisions happen in the markup via class names. This is evidenced by the minimal number of custom CSS files (just global and animations). The benefits are consistency and clarity – one can see a component’s layout by looking at its class list. For example, the Header.astro likely uses Tailwind classes for its layout, which ensures it matches the design system globally.
By using global utility classes for typographic styles (.h1, .h2, etc.), the project ensures headings look consistent even if they’re created dynamically (like in MDX content). And by applying those classes via variables, if they ever want to adjust font sizes or families, they can do so in one place.
The design tokens (colors, spacing) being used everywhere means the site has a cohesive look: spacing between elements is always one of the defined increments (--spacing-sm, --spacing-md, etc.), not arbitrary values. Colors are drawn from the palette (primary, secondary, accent, neutral) defined at the top of global.css
GitHub
. This is very much aligned with design system best practices.
The project likely uses the Inter and Poppins fonts (as set in CSS variables for base and heading font)
GitHub
. It’s unclear if they included these fonts via import or if they rely on system fonts fallback (the code says 'Inter', sans-serif so presumably they might import Inter somewhere or assume it’s globally available). It might be an improvement to include a webfont or use Astro’s integration to preload these, but that’s a minor detail outside code structure.
We should mention Tailwind version alignment: TailwindCSS v4 is used, which is very new. As of early 2025, v4.1 is out (the tailwind docs show v4.1 at top). The project’s version ^4.0.9 will allow minor upgrades, so likely it can go to 4.1.x. Tailwind 4 introduced some changes like using Lightning CSS (which could have some different behaviors, e.g., it doesn’t use PostCSS so @apply with complex selectors might behave a bit differently). The custom CSS uses @apply but mostly on simple utility classes, which should be fine. The project should test that all custom utilities compile correctly under Lightning CSS (they appear to, given we could read them in the GitHub source, they must have compiled).
Without a config file, they might miss out on customizing Tailwind’s purge, but they also might miss customizing things like the container class (by default Tailwind’s container max-widths might not match their design). They define their own .container class in CSS
GitHub
 to center and set a max-width of 1200px, which is fine and perhaps simpler for them. In Tailwind config, one could also define theme.container.center = true and custom padding, but doing it manually is equally effective.
Potential Issues in Styling:
The purge (content) configuration is the most significant concern. We highly recommend adding content paths. If the site appears fine in dev but loses styles in production, this would be the cause. Ensuring content includes .astro, .mdx, .jsx, etc., will fix that. It’s a one-line change but crucial.
No explicit PostCSS config: With Tailwind 4, using the plugin means we don’t necessarily need a postcss.config.js (Lightning CSS is used internally). The @import "tailwindcss"; in CSS is being handled by the plugin. If a developer was expecting to use other PostCSS plugins, they’d have to configure them, but it seems they are not. The current setup is fine for Tailwind alone.
File size: If purge is not configured, the CSS file could be enormous (all Tailwind classes). If it is configured properly (either by default or by adding config), then the CSS will only include used classes plus the custom ones. Given the extensive use of arbitrary values, Tailwind’s JIT will generate only those classes needed (like mb-[var(--spacing-sm)] becomes a specific class in the output). The custom classes in global.css and animations.css are also part of output.
Because they rely on variables in class names, Tailwind can’t purge those via content scanning because they appear directly in the CSS (@apply usage ensures the base utilities are included). But if they, for example, wrote a class name dynamically in React (className={someColor}), that could be missed. It appears they did not do dynamic class construction with unenumerated strings, which is good (all classes are literal in the code or in the CSS files).
Styling vs. Best Practices: This project’s styling methodology stands up well against modern best practices:
Utility-first CSS (with Tailwind) is very popular and effective in 2025 for consistent design.
Using CSS variables for a design system is a forward-thinking approach (some teams use Tailwind’s config for design tokens, others use CSS variables – here we see a hybrid that gets the best of both).
The only slight divergence from standard practice is not using a tailwind config file for content and theming, but that’s easily rectified. Possibly it was an oversight or the project was quickly set up. Official integration (astro add tailwind) would have created a config by default; since they manually installed tailwindcss@latest, they might have skipped that step.
Design Consistency: All signs indicate the site’s design is consistent:
Spacing and typography are uniform.
There are no contradictory style definitions (e.g., two different margin conventions) – everything refers back to the design tokens or Tailwind defaults.
The content uses the same classes defined globally. For instance, in the FAQ meta, the heading classes h2 text-left mb-[var(--spacing-sm)] are exactly using the global heading class and spacing token
GitHub
. This shows consistency between content authorship and defined styles.
If the site had a style guide or multiple contributors, this setup would prevent many common issues (like someone using a slightly different shade of color or a random margin). Tailwind inherently encourages consistency by offering a limited set of values (or in this case, consistently using variables).
Another consistency point: the project likely ensures responsive design by using Tailwind’s responsive utilities. We see md:text-2xl in a heading class definition
GitHub
, meaning medium screens and up get a larger heading. This implies the design has been considered for different breakpoints. Tailwind’s default breakpoints (sm, md, lg, etc.) are likely in effect (since no custom breakpoints were set in a config, the default of md = 768px etc. applies). The code uses those defaults. This is indeed the typical approach – an industry-standard practice for responsive design with Tailwind.
Summary of Tailwind usage: The project uses Tailwind in a modern, effective way, with customizations that enhance rather than complicate:
It is using the latest Tailwind with the recommended integration (a sign of staying current).
It maintains design consistency through central tokens and utility classes.
Only improvement needed is adding a Tailwind config for purge and any future theming in a more official way (though the current method works, it’s just a safety net and DX improvement to have the config).
Now we’ll consider MDX/Markdown content rendering and any issues or best practices related to content.
MDX Content Rendering and Usage
Greactstro uses MDX (Markdown with JSX) extensively for content, which is a powerful choice for a content-rich site. Let’s break down how MDX is used and if it aligns with best practices: Content Organization: Each content collection (Services, Projects, FAQ, Testimonials, Clients, etc.) has MDX files for items. For example:
In Services: seo.mdx, web-design.mdx, website-creation.mdx are individual service descriptions, each with frontmatter and content.
An _meta.mdx in each folder provides collection-level frontmatter (like section headings and whether to generate pages)
GitHub
GitHub
. Notably, after the frontmatter, these meta files can also include MDX content (Astro/JSX components) that define how the collection page should be structured
GitHub
.
The structure is logical: content files focus on content, meta focuses on configuration. This separation is beneficial because it allows non-technical content editors to edit the main content of pages (text, images, etc.) without touching the layout logic, unless they want to rearrange sections.
Frontmatter & Schema: The frontmatter of content MDX files contains defined fields that match the schema in content/config.ts. For instance, in seo.mdx (Service collection):
md
Copy
Edit
---
title: "SEO"
description: "Boost your site's rankings with SEO best practices."
icon: "📈"
featuredImage: "../../assets/glen-rushton-PjeZGaKunAI-unsplash.jpg"
# order: 3
# parent: "web-design"
# addToMenu: ... (commented out example)
---
Our SEO services improve your website's visibility...
GitHub
GitHub
 This shows:
Required fields like title (string)
GitHub
.
Optional fields like description, icon, featuredImage as defined in the schema (the schema extends a base with those fields)
GitHub
.
Some commented out fields like order, parent, addToMenu which are part of the schema but not used here (perhaps left as documentation or future use). order could override sorting, parent could nest services, addToMenu could inject this item into a menu. The schema indeed has these fields (e.g., parent: reference("services") for hierarchical services
GitHub
). In this particular file, they left them commented, meaning the defaults or external logic will apply (no parent, natural sort order, etc.).
The body below the frontmatter is a Markdown paragraph describing the service
GitHub
. In MDX, you can also include JSX components in the body. It appears most content bodies are just text (which will be rendered as HTML <p> etc.). If they wanted, they could embed images or interactive content in MDX as well.
Rendering of MDX content:
On a collection listing page, typically you don’t render full MDX bodies for each item; you might just show a title and maybe a description excerpt. In Greactstro, the Section component by default uses item.data.title and maybe an excerpt for each item when listing. It passes each item to the item component. For example:
If using a Card component for services, that card might render item.data.title, maybe an image, and a link.
If using AccordionItem for FAQ, as we saw, it renders item.data.title in the header and item.data.description ?? item.body for the content
GitHub
GitHub
. In the FAQ meta, they set itemsHasPage: false
GitHub
 meaning each FAQ question doesn’t get its own page; they are only shown in the accordion list. So in that case, using description vs body is just a choice of whether to show a short answer or the full answer in the accordion. They chose to prefer description if available, else fallback to the full body. For a FAQ, that makes sense: perhaps description might contain a concise answer and body could have a longer explanation. This flexibility is nice, but one must ensure to consistently provide or not provide those fields to avoid confusion (e.g., if one FAQ has a description and others don’t, some answers might show more detail than others).
On an individual item page (like /services/seo), the template [collection]/[slug].astro will render Content = rendered.Content and then <Content /> inside the layout
GitHub
GitHub
. That means the full MDX body (markdown) of the service will appear on the page, converted to HTML. This is where longer content goes (like a case study description, etc.). Additionally, because the site has related sections, below that content it will render, say, "Related Projects" and "Client Testimonials" if any are linked
GitHub
GitHub
. The _meta.mdx for services defines such itemsSections queries ("related" queries likely filter projects/testimonials by references to this service)
GitHub
. The CollectionQueryUtils.ts probably implements that logic by checking, for example, in each project if project.data.services includes the current service ID.
The MDX content is thus well-integrated into the page with both static content and dynamic queries.
MDX v3 Consideration: The integration version (@astrojs/mdx 4.3.0) likely supports MDX 2. We saw an MDX 3 migration note which said “couple small changes”. MDX 3 mainly requires Node 18 and changes how plugins are configured, but from a content perspective, nothing major. If Astro upgrades to MDX 3 internally, the content here should continue to work without changes (maybe slight differences in how imports are handled, but since this uses relatively straightforward MDX, it’s fine).
MDX vs Markdown: The project chose .mdx extension for content, even though many files are just Markdown and frontmatter without any embedded React/JSX. Using MDX everywhere is okay (Astro’s content collections allow .md or .mdx). MDX gives the option to import components or use JSX if needed. In _meta.mdx they do import and use <Section> components, which is a good example of MDX’s power
GitHub
. If those were .md files, they couldn’t include components. So using MDX uniformly is wise, even if some items don’t currently have JSX in them – it keeps the door open for richer content.
Content Rendering Best Practices:
The use of Astro’s entry.render() to get a component for MDX content is standard. Astro ensures that any JSX in MDX is handled and that things like syntax highlighting or embedded components are properly rendered.
The project passes down props like collection and entry into layout and section components. This is fine as long as those components know how to use them (the layouts mainly use them for metadata).
SEO: Because content is static, SEO is largely about having the right headings, meta tags, and structured content. The meta tags are handled by SEO.astro which receives title, description, keywords, etc., either from the collection meta or item frontmatter
GitHub
. We see in BaseLayout that keywords and others are passed to <SEO> component
GitHub
. Likely, the layout picks up Astro.props.keywords which is set in the page frontmatter or props (the slug page sets keywords={data.keywords} from item frontmatter
GitHub
, and the collection index sets keywords={meta.keywords}
GitHub
). This ensures each page has relevant meta description and keywords tags, which is good practice.
One should verify if open-graph images or such are needed; the featuredImage in content could be used for an OG image tag. The SEO.astro component likely does that by using image={image} prop
GitHub
. In BaseLayout, image = SiteData.logo by default, but in the slug page, they do image={data.image} (not shown, but they pass entry={entry} to layout
GitHub
, and BaseLayout might pick Astro.props.image = entry.data.featuredImage if provided). Actually, BaseLayout’s frontmatter merges props with SiteData, but does not explicitly show it using entry.data.featuredImage. Perhaps the SEO component itself might look at Astro.props.entry if provided. This detail aside, the intention seems to allow OG images per content.
Content consistency: As noted, some content values seemed off (e.g., cleaning services keywords in what looks like a web development site). This likely is placeholder data. It’s important in a content audit to point that out, because if not corrected it can confuse SEO and users. But that’s a content editing task, not a structural issue.
MDX and Menu Integration: The content meta includes addToMenu and itemsAddToMenu arrays
GitHub
. These are used to generate navigation. For example, Services _meta.mdx:
yaml
Copy
Edit
addToMenu:
  - menu: mainMenu
    order: 2
itemsAddToMenu:
  - menu: mainMenu
    parent: "services"
    # respectHierarchy: true
GitHub
 This likely means:
Add the services section itself to the mainMenu (order 2 in top-level).
Add each service item to the mainMenu, under the parent menu item with ID "services".
The menus.json in content would define a menu with id "mainMenu". menuItems.json or MenuItemsLoader aggregates menu entries from all collections that have such declarations. This is a fairly novel approach – content drives the menu structure. Many industry sites either hardcode menus or use a CMS. Here it’s done via frontmatter, which is actually quite nice for static sites. It means if you add a new Service and you want it in the nav dropdown, you just ensure itemsAddToMenu is set for the collection, and it appears.
This is a bit beyond typical Astro examples, but it’s aligned with a content-driven architecture (similar to how some headless CMS let you tag content to appear in navigation).
As a best practice, one must ensure the Menu component properly uses these and that there is fallback if, say, content is missing or out of order. Given the utility MenuItemsLoader, they probably compile everything into a structure at build time, which is efficient.
MDX Performance: MDX compilation can be a bit slower than plain MD, but it’s done at build time. There’s no evidence of an unusual number of MDX files (a few in each collection, maybe dozens in total), which Astro can handle easily. The benefit is the rich content possibilities. If the site grew to hundreds of MDX files, build times might rise (due to Zod validation and MDX compilation), but that’s expected and manageable by Astro’s optimizations and caching.
Comparison to Modern MDX Usage: MDX is widely used in docs/blogs. Using it for a marketing/content site is slightly less common but gaining traction. Greactstro uses MDX in a modern way:
It fully utilizes MDX’s capability to include components and dynamic content in markup (which many might underuse).
It ensures type safety via schemas (which not everyone does, but it’s a best practice).
It doesn’t misuse MDX for things like storing huge data blobs; it keeps content human-readable and structured.
If anything, a suggestion could be: consider splitting extremely large pages or using Markdown for simple content if MDX features aren’t needed to reduce build overhead. But given the scale here, that’s not an issue. Finally, let’s consolidate performance and any inefficiencies noticed:
Performance & Optimization
Performance Strengths:
Static Generation: The site is statically generated (Astro’s default), meaning each page is just HTML/CSS (and some JS islands) served to the user. This yields fast Time-to-First-Byte and allows CDN caching. The heavy use of content collections does not change this; it just means build time does more work, not the user’s browser.
Partial Hydration / Islands: Only a subset of components are hydrated on the client. The approach of using client:visible for things like FAQ ensures that if a user never views that section, no JS is executed for it. Using client:idle (which they do in some cases per config) would load after initial page load, further reducing main thread work during page load. This aligns with modern performance best practices, focusing on interaction readiness for what’s in the viewport and deferring the rest.
Code-Splitting: The manual chunk split for React vendor and the dynamic imports for component modules mean that the JavaScript payload is not monolithic. A user will likely load the base Astro runtime and some small bootstrap, then React (~40KB), then only the chunks needed. For example, on the homepage, they might load the services list chunk (if it uses a Card component with maybe no hydration, that might have been SSR only so no chunk beyond a bit of common code), and the accordion component chunk when scrolling to FAQ. If they navigate to a service detail page, a slider chunk might load if a carousel is present, etc. The architecture allows for good caching: the React vendor chunk is reused, and each feature’s code is isolated.
CSS Loading: Tailwind’s CSS (once properly purged) will be relatively small. The use of CSS variables doesn’t hinder performance; if anything, it reduces CSS duplication by centralizing values. The custom CSS for animations and utilities is not too large (a few hundred lines) and only included once. They avoid heavy frameworks for CSS, relying on Tailwind and modern CSS, which keeps things efficient.
Images: The presence of Astro’s <Image /> component means they intend to optimize images. Astro’s build will create responsive image variants and serve them with proper <img srcset>. This dramatically improves performance for images (faster loads, appropriately sized for device). We should ensure they use it wherever beneficial (like the featuredImage on a project or service page – likely in a component or layout, they’d use <Image src={...featuredImage} alt={...} />). Since they imported Image in [slug].astro
GitHub
, they may use it to render entry.data.featuredImage if present. This is excellent for performance.
Animations and Interaction: The custom animations (scroll linked, etc.) are designed to be efficient: using CSS where possible (which offloads work to the browser’s compositor and timeline, likely more efficient than JS heavy animation), and using IntersectionObserver for broad support. This means animations (like elements fading in on scroll) won’t cause jank or large script execution – they leverage browser internals.
Potential Performance Issues or Bottlenecks:
Tailwind Purge: As discussed, if purge content isn’t configured, the CSS could include a lot of unused styles, which negatively impacts performance (extra network load for CSS, and possibly slight runtime style calculation overhead). It’s important to fix this by adding the content config. This is likely the biggest performance tweak needed.
Initial Load JS: While code-splitting is great, the site still needs to load React for any interactive component. If a user lands on a page where some React is above the fold (say a homepage hero slider, if it existed, or a call-to-action button that’s actually a React component for some reason), the React chunk must load to enable it. The good news: if there’s no above-the-fold interactive component, the user might not load React until they scroll or interact (depending on client directives). For example, on the homepage, if the hero and service list are static, React may not load until the FAQ section scrolls into view. That’s optimal. On the other hand, if the header had a React hamburger menu, that would load React on page load. It’s unclear if the hamburger menu uses client:idle or something. If not, it might be loaded immediately to ensure the menu can open. However, client:idle could be perfect for that (load React a few seconds after page load, so if the user goes to click the menu, hopefully it’s ready by then).
SEO vs Hydration: We touched on this: content that is only rendered by React on the client will not be visible to search engine crawlers (which typically don’t execute JS or do so minimally). The site’s approach of SSR for most content mitigates that, but the FAQ answers might be an exception if they rely on client to show up. If AccordionItem was not rendered at all in HTML (because it was lazy), then crawlers see only questions, no answers. This could reduce SEO value of the FAQ page. To address this, one could either mark FAQ as client:idle instead of visible (so it still SSRs content but hydrates later) or use an alternative approach for SEO (like expanding all answers in a <noscript> block). This is a niche detail but worth noting since the question explicitly asks for performance and inefficiencies (and SEO is somewhat related).
Build Time: The build process, with many content items and complex logic, might be somewhat slow, but that only affects developer experience, not end-users. If it becomes an issue, Astro’s incremental or selective building could be explored in the future.
Large Content Payloads: If any content item is very large (long Markdown), that HTML will be present in the page. This is fine; static HTML is usually not a problem until extremely large. Possibly, the testimonials or projects might have long text, but likely nothing too massive.
Third-Party Scripts: None are mentioned, but if there were analytics or embeds, those can be performance killers. It appears the site is clean of such things (which is good).
Modern Best Practices Comparison:
Greactstro’s performance strategy (island architecture, lazy hydration, code splitting, image optimization) is in line with how modern static sites are built for optimal performance (often referred to as “astro approach” or “partial hydration”). It contrasts with older JAMstack sites that might ship a big JS bundle.
The upcoming web trends (like React Server Components or progressive hydration) are also aiming for this kind of efficiency. Astro already achieves much of that. One could argue that using React 19 (if it were stable) could allow using React’s new features like RSC or streaming SSR, but Astro doesn’t integrate React in that way since Astro itself handles the server rendering. So Astro’s current approach is fine.
No use of heavy client-side frameworks like Redux or big UI libraries was detected – a lean approach which is good. Even for UI like carousels, they built a custom one instead of pulling in, say, Swiper or another library, saving a lot of bytes (Swiper is great but heavy; their custom Carousel is likely much smaller).
They do not appear to use any heavy images or videos without optimization. The unsplash image referenced is likely quite large by default, but hopefully, the Astro Image component takes care of resizing. If not, using a large image could hurt performance. If featuredImage is output with <img src="...unsplash.jpg" /> raw, that might be a huge photo being loaded scaled down via CSS. That would be a performance issue. We should ensure they indeed use the optimized Image component for those. Since featuredImage is included in content, they likely intend to use it in some <Image> tag (Astro’s Image can import local images as we see import Logo from "@/assets/astro.svg" in SiteData
GitHub
, but for an MDX reference to unsplash, they might rely on just linking to an external URL which doesn’t optimize it. If that unsplash link is full resolution, that could be heavy. As an improvement, they might download and include it in src/assets for optimization or use a lower resolution. This is a minor detail, but worth mentioning: always optimize images, either self-host or use a CDN’s transform features.)
Accessibility and performance: The site uses semantic HTML via Astro’s default markdown renderer (MDX to HTML ensures headings, lists, etc., are proper). The Button components include aria-label if needed
GitHub
, and images have alt in SiteData for logo
GitHub
. These touches help performance indirectly by improving UX (accessible sites are often faster too because of better practices).
Now, let’s collate version usage vs. latest stable in a table for clarity, as requested, and then give final recommendations.
Version Alignment and Dependencies
The table below compares the versions of major technologies used in Greactstro to the latest stable releases (as of 2025) and notes any misalignments:
Technology	Greactstro Version	Current Stable (2025)	Notes & Best Practice Alignment
Astro Framework	Astro ^5.9.1
GitHub
 (Astro 2.x series)	Astro 2.x (latest ~2.9) – Up-to-date	The project is using a recent Astro version (5.5.6/5.9.1). This is aligned with the latest features (content collections, assets, etc.). No upgrade needed; just keep up with Astro’s minor updates.
UI Framework	React ^19.0.0
GitHub
 (React 19 RC)	React 18.2 (latest stable)	React 19 is in beta/RC. Most projects are on v18. Recommend using React 18.2 for stability unless React 19 becomes stable and is needed.
React DOM ^19.0.0
GitHub
React DOM 18.2	Same as above – stick to the stable 18.x line for now. React 19’s new features (if not used) don’t outweigh potential incompatibilities.
Astro Integrations	@astrojs/mdx ^4.3.0
GitHub
@astrojs/mdx 4.x (MDX v2/v3)	Latest Astro MDX integration. Likely MDX v2 under the hood; MDX v3 is available but Astro will update when ready. No issues; maintain current version.
@astrojs/react ^4.3.0
GitHub
@astrojs/react 4.x	Latest React integration for Astro. Works with React 18 and should work with 19 (if carefully). Keep updated alongside Astro.
@astrojs/sitemap ^3.4.1
GitHub
@astrojs/sitemap 3.x	Up-to-date. Ensure to generate sitemap after build (likely automated).
Styling	Tailwind CSS ^4.0.9
GitHub
Tailwind CSS 4.1	Using Tailwind 4 (very new). Tailwind 4.x is current in 2025. Minor update to 4.1 available (improved Lightning CSS engine). Just add a config for content paths.
@tailwindcss/vite ^4.0.9
GitHub
@tailwindcss/vite 4.x	Matches Tailwind version. This replaces the older Astro Tailwind integration (which is deprecated). Good choice for Tailwind 4.
Utilities	dotenv ^16.5.0
GitHub
dotenv 16.5	Latest 16.x (for Node 16+). Properly used for dev only. No issues.
Zod (astro:content) – internal	Zod 3.x (used via Astro)	Astro content uses Zod v3 internally. The schemas are written correctly. No direct dep, but it’s modern.
TypeScript	TypeScript – (not explicit in deps)	TypeScript ~5.x	Astro projects use TS if available. The environment likely has TS 5 if needed. The project uses some .ts files, so presumably TS is configured. No version issues.
Other	@types/react ^19.0.10
GitHub
@types/react 18.x	The types match React 19 which is currently RC. If reverting to React 18, switch to @types/react 18.0.x.
@types/react-dom ^19.0.4
GitHub
@types/react-dom 18.x	Same as above. Keep types in sync with React version to avoid inconsistencies.

Summary: The project is using the latest stable versions for Astro and Tailwind, which is excellent. The only notable version misalignment is React 19 vs. 18. Since React 19 is not officially stable (as of mid-2025) and has caused issues in some tooling, the safer route is to use React 18. Otherwise, ensure that all libraries (Astro’s integration, testing libs, etc.) are React-19 compatible. Everything else (Astro, Tailwind, MDX integration) is modern and at least at the current best practice level or better. Now, based on all the findings above, we will present targeted recommendations for improvements and modernization. We’ll structure these by area, as requested, possibly in a table format (Issue/Observation → Recommendation).
Recommendations for Improvement
Based on the audit, Greactstro is well-built, but there are always areas to refine to align with best practices and upcoming trends. Below is a summary of key improvements and modernization steps:
Area	Observation / Issue	Recommendation
React Version & Ecosystem	Use of React 19 RC: The project uses React 19.0.0 (beta)
GitHub
, which is not yet the standard. This can cause peer dependency warnings and potential incompatibilities (e.g., with testing libraries or Astro’s expectations).	Standardize on React 18 for now: Downgrade to React ^18.2.0 (and matching react-dom and @types/react versions) unless React 19 has officially stabilized and all ecosystem tools support it. This will eliminate any version mismatch issues. Once React 19 is officially released and proven, you can upgrade back. Make sure to also adjust the Astro React integration if needed (it likely will work with either).
TailwindCSS Configuration	Missing Tailwind Config: There is no tailwind.config.js found. Without it, Tailwind may not know which files to scan for class names, risking missing styles or outputting bloated CSS.	Add a Tailwind config with content paths: Create a tailwind.config.cjs (or .js) at the root. Include a content array that covers all source files, e.g.:
content: ["./src/**/*.{astro,html,js,jsx,ts,tsx,mdx}"].
Also, use this config to future-proof theme values: you can map your CSS variables into Tailwind’s theme (optional). For example, define colors: { primary: "rgb(29,78,216)" /* or var(--color-primary) */ , ... } so you could use text-primary instead of text-[var(--color-primary)]. This isn’t required, but it can improve DX (autocompletion, etc.). The critical part is the content path to ensure proper purging of unused classes.
CSS & Design Tokens	Design tokens via CSS variables: The project uses CSS custom properties for colors, spacing, etc., which is good. However, Tailwind’s engine might not be aware of these for generating variant classes (like hover states for custom colors).	Integrate design tokens into Tailwind theme (optional): In the new tailwind config, consider injecting your CSS variables into the theme. For example, use Tailwind’s ability to reference CSS variables:
theme: { colors: { primary: "rgb(var(--color-primary) / <alpha-value>)", ... } } which allows bg-primary/50 etc. This would let you use Tailwind class names (e.g., text-primary) instead of bracket syntax. It’s not mandatory since your current approach works, but it can enhance maintainability. Regardless, document the design tokens in a README for team reference.
Performance – CSS Payload	Potential unused CSS: If content is not configured, the generated CSS may include all of Tailwind (many KB of unused styles), hurting performance.	Implement Purge (via content config): (This ties to adding the config file above.) Once content paths are set, build the site and verify the CSS file size. It should drop significantly to only include used classes and your custom layers. This will improve load times. Additionally, verify that all expected styles are still present (in case some classes were only referenced in unusual ways that purge might miss – e.g., classes built dynamically in JS, which I don’t see here, so likely fine).
Hydration & SEO	FAQ content hydration: The FAQ section uses client:visible with a lazy-loaded Accordion. It’s possible that the FAQ answers aren’t in the HTML until hydrated (depending on how React Suspense handled it). That means search engines might not see the answer text.	Ensure critical content is SSR’d: Two approaches: 1) Change FAQ to client:idle (so it loads after page render but Astro will SSR the content immediately, just without interactivity). client:idle still hydrates it, but it would ensure the HTML contains the Q&A content on initial load (which is better for SEO and for users with JS disabled). 2) Alternatively, keep client:visible but provide a <noscript> fallback or an expanded static version of FAQ for crawlers. The simpler route is using client:idle. Since FAQ is low in the page, using idle is almost as good as visible from a performance standpoint (it will hydrate a bit later after load). This way, you don’t compromise SEO. Evaluate this trade-off and test what Google sees (fetch as Google or view page source to confirm if answers are present).
Navigation & Menu Data	Content-driven menu: The site builds menus from content meta. While powerful, it can be complex to manage. Also, currently, some important pages like “About Us” or “Contact Us” might not be in the menu by default (since they are static pages not in a collection).	Review menu configuration: Ensure that all desired pages are included. For static pages, you might add them to menus.json manually or create a small collection for “pages” to drive menu links. Since you have a menu system, use it uniformly. For instance, add an entry for about-us in menus.json or via an addToMenu in some _meta. If maintaining menu via content becomes cumbersome, an acceptable simpler solution is to hardcode a small menu in Header.astro for top-level links (especially if site structure is mostly static). But given the current system, just make sure it’s populated correctly. The menu content system itself is innovative – document it for content editors, e.g., “To add a new menu item, do X in _meta.mdx or menus.json.”
Code Maintainability	JavaScript vs TypeScript: Some utilities are in JS, which could benefit from type-checking. Also, there are a lot of moving parts in the content logic that would benefit from tests.	Increase type safety and testing: Convert remaining *.js in src/utils to TypeScript (rename to .ts and fix any types). Astro supports TS and this will help catch errors (for example, ensuring a function returns the expected type). Moreover, consider writing unit tests for critical utilities like CollectionQueryUtils (to verify “related” query logic, etc.) and maybe integration tests for the content system. While Astro doesn’t have a built-in testing framework, you can use something like Vitest for utilities, and Playwright for end-to-end tests (to simulate a user clicking the FAQ accordion, for instance, to ensure it works and is accessible). This isn’t a direct modernization “must,” but it aligns with industry practices to have automated tests, especially given the complexity.
Content Review	Placeholder content and metadata: Some content appears placeholder (e.g., SiteData.title “Griffins Site”, services keywords referring to “cleaning services” unrelatedly
GitHub
). This can confuse users or hurt SEO if not addressed.	Audit and update content copy: Go through all MDX content and the SiteData. Update the site title, tagline, and descriptions to accurately reflect the site’s purpose (e.g., if this is a web agency demo, tailor keywords to that). Remove or replace any lorem ipsum or mismatched text. This will improve credibility and SEO relevance. It’s a simple content task but important for polish.
Images and Media	Image optimization: The project references images (like Unsplash URLs and an Astro SVG logo). If using external images (Unsplash), they may not be optimized or sized for web by default.	Optimize images via Astro or CDN: Wherever possible, bring images into src/assets and use the Astro <Image> component to serve responsive, optimized versions
GitHub
. For example, instead of linking directly to an Unsplash CDN large image, download a reasonably large version (or use Unsplash’s query params for width) and put it in src/assets. Then do import seoImage from "../assets/glen-rushton-PjeZGaKunAI-unsplash.jpg"; and use <Image src={seoImage} alt="SEO illustration" />. Astro will output multiple sizes and use modern formats. This can drastically improve load time for image-heavy pages. Also, compress any static images (like logos or icons) – the SVG is fine (SVGs are small and already optimized typically).
Future Astro Upgrades	Astro new features: Astro is actively evolving. Upcoming versions might introduce things like View Transitions API integration or improved Server-side rendering modes, etc.	Keep an eye on Astro releases: Join Astro’s Discord or newsletter to stay informed. For example, if Astro introduces an official way to handle menus or relationships, consider adopting it to reduce custom code. Another example: Astro 3.0 (hypothetically) might improve the way content collections can be globally queried or how assets are handled (maybe remote images support). Staying updated ensures you can refactor to simpler solutions when they become available.
Documentation	Project complexity: As noted, this project has many custom patterns. It’s manageable for you as the author, but new contributors might need guidance.	Document the system: Create a CONTRIBUTING.md or expand the README to explain the project structure (especially the content collection scheme, how to add new content or sections, how the menu system works). Document how to run and build the project, and any gotchas (e.g., “If you add a new collection, remember to update X or check Y”). This isn’t a code change, but it’s a modernization of project practices making it more team-friendly and aligned with professional standards.

By implementing these recommendations, Greactstro will become even more robust and maintainable. Many of these are incremental improvements (configuration tweaks, version alignments) that will yield benefits in performance and developer experience. The core architecture is strong, so the focus is on polishing and future-proofing. With these changes, the project will align fully with the latest best practices in the Astro ecosystem and web development in general, positioning it well for growth and longevity.
